### Instructions.
This is our location for the GA-CDRC Data Group Stata training.  
You will find all datasets for this training programme in the dataset repository `data_statatraining`  
  
*EACH WEEK* you should read the associated Stata Training Instructions. Each training week also has its own page in the repository wiki - look to the sidebar for these instructions. The instructions will give you the name and location of the required dataset(s), and the Stata problem to solve. You will need to build one or more Stata `.do` files that accomplish the tasks set out in the instructions. We will give ourselves 1 week for each set of instructions. After that we will share our code and think about ways of solving the problem at hand. 
  
The training topic for each week is available at the DataGroup intranet site under [`in-house Stata training`](https://theuwi.sharepoint.com/sites/DataGroup/Lists/Inhouse%20Stata%20training/AllItems.aspx).  You can also review the specific training topics [in this wiki](https://github.com/UWI-DataGroup/repo_statatraining/wiki/Training-Topics).

The training has no specific end-date - we will keep on rolling for as long as we can think of interesting problems to solve. Training weeks are numbered from 1 upwards.
